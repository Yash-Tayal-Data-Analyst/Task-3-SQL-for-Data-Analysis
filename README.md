🏥 Hospital Data Analysis using PostgreSQL
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on a hospital dataset using PostgreSQL. I created the necessary table schema, imported the data into the database, and used SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.

🔍 Analysis Objectives
The following key business questions guided the analysis:

Total Number of Patients

Average Number of Doctors per Hospital

Top 3 Departments with the Highest Number of Patients

Hospital with the Maximum Medical Expenses

Daily Average Medical Expenses

Longest Hospital Stay

Total Patients Treated Per City

Average Length of Stay Per Department

Department with the Lowest Number of Patients

Monthly Medical Expenses Report

📊 Insights
By writing and executing SQL queries for the questions above, I uncovered several insights related to patient distribution, resource utilization, and hospital efficiency.
